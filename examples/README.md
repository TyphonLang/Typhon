# Examples

This directory contains some simple examples of Typhon code, showing off some of its current features.

This directory represents a fully-fledged [TnClipse](https://github.com/TyphonLang/TnClipse) project! For best viewing, import this folder as an existing project into your workspace.

## Running from TnClipse

Once in TnClipse, you can right-click the project, go to `Run As`, and select `TnBox`. From there, you will be asked for a main function to run.

Alternately, you can set up a dedicated launch configuration for yourself. Go to `Run As`, select `Run Configurations...`, and create a new one under `TnBox`.

## Running from the command line

You will need [TnBox](https://github.com/TyphonLang/TnBox) to run Typhon programs. Get the JAR, and run:

```
java -jar tnbox.jar <your file>.tn
```

to run an example.
